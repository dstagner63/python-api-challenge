# python-api-challenge

This homework was pretty difficult for me. However, I believe I completed all the requirements as discribed in the readme file. I made comments on the jupyter files explaining what was happening with my code. I also included my analysis of findings in my comments in these two files. The only thing I couldn't resolve was the text in my markers in the final vacation heat map. The text includes the required information but it also has the html language tags.
